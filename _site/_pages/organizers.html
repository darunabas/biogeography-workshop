            <p style="font-size:12pt;">Barnabas is an Assistant Professor at Stanford University in the Department of Biology. He has pursued his interest in plant ecology and phylogenetic biology through a combination of teaching and research. His primary work focuses on elucidating the ecology and evolutionary determinants of floristic diversity, from local to global scales. He served as Associate Editor at the journals eLife, American Journal of Botany, and he was also a subject Editor for the journal <a href="http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/374/1763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B</a>

            <p style="font-size:12pt;">David Bapst is an assistant instructional professor at Texas A&M University (TAMU), where he teaches both on-ground and online classes involving teaching how to analyze data in R for geoscientists. He is also a certified Software Carpentry instructor and regularly co-organizes and instructs Software Carpentry workshops at TAMU. His research usually involves phylogenies, R, graptolites, and a deep desire to prove that sampled ancestors are real, and you really can talk about them. He is author of the R package <code>paleotree</code>.</p>
