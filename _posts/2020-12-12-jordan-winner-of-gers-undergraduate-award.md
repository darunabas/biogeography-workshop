Jordan's presentation at GERS addressed the issue of sampling biases in collections record by disentangling areas of mismatches and congruencies in sampling biases between observations and vouchered specimens in the worldâ€™s plant occurrence records.

Jordan is an [undergraduate intern](https://barnabasdaru.com/about_jrodan/) in the Daru lab where she assists with curating plant specimens in the Ruth O'Brien Herbarium of Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi.
