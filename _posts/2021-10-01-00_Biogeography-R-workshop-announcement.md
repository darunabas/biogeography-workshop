## Biogeography in R workshop

We are excited to announce the maiden edition of a workshop in biogeographic methods and tools development in the `R` computing environment. The course will be 6 days in length and take place at the Island campus of [Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi](https://tamucc.edu/){:target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} from the January 10-15, 2021. The workshop is intended for (and open to) anyone with interest in biogeographic methods and a little prior computer programming experience, to an intermediate or advanced computational biologist curious about improving their skills in `R` for biogeography and macroecology. This means that learners will be selected from a range of career stages, including undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs. Selected participants will be asked to arrive with a dataset of their own, or with an idea for a biogeographic project in `R`.

On the first 3 days of the workshop, course leaders Drs. [April Wright](https://wright-lab.com/){:target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [Klaus Schliep](https://kschliep.netlify.app/){:target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [David Bapst](https://geogeo.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/bapstdavidwilliam.html){:target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, [Gabriel Nakamura](https://github.com/GabrielNakamura){:target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, & [Barnabas Daru](https://barnabasdaru.com/about_barnabas/){:target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} will provide an introduction to the primary data structures and methods of common biogeographic `R` packages, `R` basics and good `R` practices, the basics of computational algorithms for biogeography, and an overview of other essential topics of software development in `R` (version control, unit testing, documentation, and `R` package development), the specific details of which will depend on the prior experience of the bootcamp participants. Over the subsequent 3 workshop days participants will work in break-out groups with workshop leaders to develop a biogeographic project in `R` or develop a small `R` package on their chosen topics. These projects will focus on adding new functionality to existing `R` software in biogeography, and might range from spatial data manipulation, biogeographic inference, biome evolution, biogeographic regionalization, to visualization of biogeographic or macroevolutionary patterns in geographic space.

The workshop is funded by an award from the National Science Foundation to Dr. Barnabas Daru ([NSF DBI-2113424](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2113424&HistoricalAwards=false){:target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}), with additional support from Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. All accepted students originating from a U.S. port of origin will have their travel costs covered or defrayed, and room and board during the workshop will be provided. As the workshop will be held on the beautiful island campus of Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, accommodation is comfortable as participants will be stationed in their own bedroom but with shared bathroom with another participant.

**_All participants are expected to follow CDC and Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi’s COVID-19 safety protocols – participants are encouraged to wear a mask and social distance at all times_** ([more information on COVID-19 campus guide is available here ](https://www.tamucc.edu/campus-guide/index.php){:target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}). To greatly expand access and participation, the lectures from these workshops will also be webcast for other interested parties to participate.

To apply for the course, please complete the following [form](https://tamucc.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4YOcN3cvPh1iSeW){: .btn .btn--small .btn--success}{:target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Details of relevant programming background (computer languages, `R` knowledge, GitHub repositories, …) should also be provided. Admission is competitive, and preference will go towards students with background in biogeography, basic to moderate experience in computer programming (ability to read a data file into `R` or a similar language and parse it for information, familiarity with iteration and functions, ability to identify when to use basic datatypes such as vectors and dataframes, and comfort with using help documentation to find answers), and a compelling motivation for taking the course. Applications should be submitted via the form by *November 1, 2021*. Questions can be directed to barnabas.daru@tamucc.edu
