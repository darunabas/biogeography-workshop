## Lesson 6 - Biogeographic data types

A 3-year postdoctoral position in developing analytical methods and tools for evolutionary biogeography and macroecology is available in the lab of Barnabas Daru [(https://barnabasdaru.com/)](https://barnabasdaru.com/) in the Department of Life Sciences at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. This position is part of a collaborative, 3-year NSF funded DBI project title *phyloregion, computational infrastructure for biogeographic regionalization and macroecology in the R computing environment*. The position is 100% research. 

<!--more-->

The responsibilities are to: (1) Develop new methods for biome evolution; (2) Develop new tools to visualize patterns of biogeography, macroecology and evolution; and (3) Develop new tools for conservation that reflect the key dimensions of phylogenetic diversity including richness, divergence and regularity [(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4792835)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4792835){:target="_blank"}.

The Daru Lab is supportive of opportunities for professional development (e.g., conferences).
The postdoc will also have the opportunity to participate in a biogeography-method users workshop in Laguna Madre Field Station in the Gulf of Mexico in south Texas in Years 1 and 3 of the project and Turtle Cove Field Station, Louisiana in Year 2. We strive to provide a flexible, comfortable, inclusive environment for research and professional growth.

**Essential qualifications:**  
Applicants should have a PhD in ecology, biology, evolution, biogeography, statistics or a related field, and have demonstrated expertise in spatial analysis and programming in the `R` computing environment. Prior experience with GIS/geospatial analysis, `R` package development, Git, and/or reproducible research would be an asset. Prospective postdocs from traditionally under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. 

**Application:**  
Applicants should electronically submit a single PDF containing the following:
1. a 2-page cover letter detailing your research interests and skills that match the position;  
2. a CV (with 3-5 references listed at the end)

Please submit applications via [https://tamus.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/TAMUCC_External/job/Corpus-Christi-TAMUCC/Postdoctoral-Research-Associate-in-Biogeography_R-039725](https://tamus.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/TAMUCC_External/job/Corpus-Christi-TAMUCC/Postdoctoral-Research-Associate-in-Biogeography_R-039725){:target="_blank"}   
Direct any questions to Dr. Barnabas Daru at [barnabas.daru@tamucc.edu](mailto:barnabas.daru@tamucc.edu)

The start date is September 2021, with flexibility.

**Terms of employment:**  
Salary of $40,000-$45,000 (depending on experience), health insurance, and other benefits are included.  This position is based at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, and it is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action/Veterans/Disability Employer committed to diversity.

TAMUCC, also known as the Island University is ranked number 1 on ‘The 50 Best Colleges By The Sea’ List.
