## PhD Position in Biogeography

The Daru lab [(https://barnabasdaru.com/)](https://barnabasdaru.com/) within the Department of Life Sciences at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi is seeking a PhD student to begin in Spring 2022.  The student's research will focus on a 3-year NSF funded project to develop informatics tools and methods for biogeography [(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4792835)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4792835){:target="_blank"}.
