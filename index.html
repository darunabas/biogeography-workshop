<p>Inferring patterns of biogeography can provide a window into the historical processes by which present-day biota arose and how they may evolve in the future. Although fossil data provide perhaps the most direct insights into the dynamics of the evolutionary past, such as speciation and extinction, it is often sparse for many taxonomic groups. Dated phylogenetic trees derived from DNA sequences can serve as a surrogate for detailed fossil data, and help to unravel the mechanisms shaping regional species pools at different temporal and spatial scales. More recent phylogenetic analyses have revealed the importance of dispersal, biogeography, extinction, speciation and past climates in explaining the origin and distribution of present-day biological diversity on a global scale.

<p>In this course, we will develop methods for geographical range evolution to overcome two most critical challenges in ancestral area reconstruction: i) defining ancestral areas for the reconstruction, ii) handling big datasets. We will explore the potential of the Grade of Membership model for biogeographic regionalization and biome evolution through R. The course will include seminars and discussions with guest speakers.<br>
