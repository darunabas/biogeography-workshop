## Installs

Workshop participants should have a working laptop with R installed. RStudio is strongly suggested. 

You can download the whole workshop website and lessons from [here](https://github.com/darunabas/biogeography-workshop).

Necessary R packages:

```

install.packages("phyloregion")
install.packages("ape")
install.packages("phytools") 
install.packages("phangorn") 
install.packages("tidyverse") 
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("pkgdown")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("rmarkdown")

```

If you choose not to use RStudio, a text editor that can edit plain text and Markdown files is also necessary. BBEdit or TextEdit are fine.
