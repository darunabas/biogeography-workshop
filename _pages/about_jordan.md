My name is Jordan Rodriguez and I am currently a Bachelor of Science undergrad student working towards a major in Environmental Sciences â€“ Marine and Coastal Resources with a minor in Biology here at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. I am originally from San Antonio, TX and I have always had a passion for the outdoors and nature. I am currently a Trip Leader for the Outdoor Adventures program through Recreational sports as well as the Vice President for the Islander Green Team. In the Daru lab, I am currently researching the patterns of plant sampling biases in observations vs vouchered specimens by using statistical computing and graphics through RStudio. I plan to continue lab research throughout my undergraduate and graduate terms while pursuing a degree in a botany related field.
