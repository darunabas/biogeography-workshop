### Who We Are  
This course is organized by April Wright and Barnabas Daru, in collaboration with instructor/co-organizer Klaus Schliep.

---
### Our Helpers  
This course utilizes a number of assistant instructors called ‘helpers’, who will be roving the room to help learners who are having issues, while an instructor (one of the people above) lectures and does exercises . Our helpers are just as integral to our short course being successful as our instructors - perhaps even more important!

Our current roster of helpers, and their contact information:

* Alex Aromin Email, Github: willgearty
* Paul Markley Email, Github: Leptaena

Barnabas is an Assistant Professor at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi in the Department of Life Sciences. He has pursued his interest in plant ecology and phylogenetic biology through a combination of teaching and research. His primary work focuses on elucidating the ecology and evolutionary determinants of floristic diversity, from local to global scales. He is currently an Associate Editor at the journals eLife, American Journal of Botany, and he was also a subject Editor for the journal [*Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B*](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/374/1763){:target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} special theme issue: “Museum Specimens as a Roadmap for Understanding Biodiversity in the Anthropocene”.<br>

![Klaus-Schliep]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/klaus.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}{:width="200px"}{: style="float: left; padding-right:10px"}
Klaus is a senior scientist at the Institute of Environmental Biotechnology at Graz University of Technology in Austria. His interest lies in the applications of statistics to molecular and especially evolutionary biology. He has developed several R packages including `phangorn` and `ape` and participated in several R workshops and hackathons.<br>

#### [April Wright](https://wright-lab.com/){:target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} 
![April-Wright]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/april.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}{:width="200px"}{: style="float: left; padding-right:10px"}
April is an Assistant Professor at Southeastern Louisiana University. She is a computational evolutionary biologist teaching and researching phylogenetics and comparative biology at a PUI. She also serves as an Associate Editor at the journal [*Systematic Biology*](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/pages/Editorial_Board){:target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} where she handles papers under the topic of evolution and phylogenetics.<br>

![David-Bapst]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/bapst.jpeg){:class="img-responsive"}{:width="200px"}{: style="float: left; padding-right:10px"}
David Bapst is an assistant instructional professor at Texas A&M University (TAMU), where he teaches both on-ground and online classes involving teaching how to analyze data in R for geoscientists. He is also a certified Software Carpentry instructor and regularly co-organizes and instructs Software Carpentry workshops at TAMU. His research usually involves phylogenies, R, graptolites, and a deep desire to prove that sampled ancestors are real, and you really can talk about them. Really!<br>
