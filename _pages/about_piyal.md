I am an evolutionary ecologist, broadly interested in trait variation and adaptation of organisms, especially in response to environmental and climate changes. I am interested in how plant communities change over time in relation to the biotic and abiotic stress they are subject to. 
Particularly, in my research, I study the turnover of species assemblages in a spatiotemporal framework to determine the main drivers of biodiversity patterns. With the use of novel modeling platforms and state-of-the-art approaches, I strongly believe we can develop an accurate system to decipher and predict the fate of biodiversity in a rapidly changing world and thereby implement effective measures to maintain healthy ecosystems and an efficient biosphere. I recognize myself as an experimental field biologist, not to mention my fondness for statistical modeling and that I thoroughly enjoy developing new statistical scripts for biodiversity analyses.

Currently, my work in the Daru Lab focuses on developing a modeling framework to determine the evolutionary origin of plant assemblages (biomes) in a global scale. I use occurrence data of vascular plants from a wide range of data sources (e.g. gbif, herbaria logs, personal data, other open-source databases, etc.) in combination with a calibrated phylogenetic tree of Tracheophytes to recognize “phyloregions” of the world and thereby to assess their evolutionary origin and sequential formation.
